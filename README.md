# Node app with vulnerable eval

This is not designed to be practice for vulnerability discovery but for developing exploit.

You will find a route that does an eval and will also do a safe-eval (using safe-eval version 0.4.0). Once the vagrant machine is up you can hit it on port 4000 of the host machine.

Thanks!
